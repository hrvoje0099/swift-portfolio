# Hangman
[Hangman](https://github.com/Hrvoje0099/100-days-of-swift/tree/master/Challenge3) is an iOS word-guessing game, which I recently built as a take-home project. In Hangman a player guessing letter-by-letter to guess the entire word, within a certain number of attempts.

Hangman is written entirely in Swift. First words are in JSON file for the first start of application. A later player can add new words and delete existing. Game words are in two languages: English and Croatian, a user to chose with which one wants to play. Also in settings player can show or hide "hint" label below the guessed word, to make the game easier or harder. UI elements and their constrains are added programmatically.
